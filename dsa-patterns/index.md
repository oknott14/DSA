## Study Plan

### Arrays and strings

- Two Pointers — Pair/triplet finding, palindromes, in-place manipulation
- Sliding Window — Subarray/substring problems with a size or value constraint
- Binary Search — Sorted array lookups and binary search on answer space
- Prefix Sum — Range sum queries, subarray sum problems
- Kadane's Algorithm — Maximum subarray sum and its variants
- Cyclic Sort — Missing/duplicate number problems on arrays with range [1, n]
- In-Place Reversal — Array rotation, reversing subarrays without extra space
- Monotonic Stack — Next greater/smaller element, histogram and span problems
- XOR Tricks — Finding unique/missing elements in O(n) time and O(1) space
- Interval Merge / Line Sweep — Overlapping interval detection, scheduling problems
